# Homework 1

My name is Alexander, and I am 21 years old. I am in my third year of a bachelor's degree in mathematics and statistics. I have lived in California and the Netherlands. I enjoy working out in my free time.

I wouldn't say I have much experience with data science, except for some statistical courses I have taken. Aside from that, I have family members with experience in data science, so in addition to school, talking and discussing with them has given me some, but limited, insight.
